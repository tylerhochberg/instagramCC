Give it a list of accounts to copy from, it will scan a post that you want from a randomly selected account whether it's a regular post, reel, or album, and download it to your computer. Give the program your instagram login and it will automate posting it for you. Also, it will delete the content from your computer immediately after posting! Since I didn't expect to be uploading this code to git, the code is a little sloppy especially around the D.R.Y principle, but otherwise still works.

Steps
- 
1) Enter your instagram login in the designated fields (pen1st line and second line).
2) Make a list of accounts you want to copy from.
3) Type what type of media you want (post, reel, album).
4) Videos and photos should automatically open, manually check album photos/videos.
5) Type yes or no (y, n) as to whether you want them uploaded to your account or not.
6) Let the system upload to the account.


This program is entirely terminal based.
First three (3) lines of code are the ones that you want to touch, and arguably the most important lines of information.
